# rise-item-visualizer
Interactive item visualization for Rise, a custom Warcraft 3 map by Rel!chunter. Fan-made helper to explore item crafting.
This interactive graph was made entirely by me, using the [vis-network](https://visjs.github.io/vis-network/) library.
It allows users to explore item combinations, tiers, and effects in a customizable and navigable layout.

The map and its content (including item names and mechanics) belong to Rel!chunter.
This file is just a fan-made tool to visualize part of it.
